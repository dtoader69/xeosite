            <!-- Our journey started with a trip to Cluj, with our computer science teacher, Sebastian Onac. He called four of us a few days before, asking us if we could attend a robotics presentation.
            We have arrived at the conference hall of a high school in Cluj, without having big expectations. The presentation brought us the idea of an international robotics championship, First Tech Challenge, very popular in The United States, but more important, a robot that won a lot of championships, in countries such as Russia, Germany and Australia. The creators of the robot (Team Autovortex, Bucharest) were the ones that brought the tournament to Romania, for the first time, last year, and they were also the ones that held the presentation. Our enthusiasm was constantly growing as the organizers were telling us that we could build our own robot, with a kit consisting of different parts worth 3000 euros, that was going to be given to us for free, after registering in the Championship.
             
            
            The days spent waiting for the kit have passed really fast, and meanwhile, we managead to grow our team to 20 members, chosen through the recommendations of the professors, do the organizing and PR steps: T-shirts, roll-up, website, email, facebook page, individual and group photos. The moment we found out that this project isn’t just a dream was at the freshman’s party. The whole team, who was at the party, with their eyes at their phones, waiting for the kit from USA to come, via FTC caravan from Bucharest. 13 members showed up around 2 o’clock in the morning to welcome the kit and discovering what we had received in the first all-nighter of the Xeo history.
            The school offered us a space for developing the robot, which we have transformed in the first robotics laboratory from the local high-schools: painted, furnished, equipped. This is how our adventure started…
             
            
            The ambition for building a competitive robot helped us pass the obstacles we met. The fact that we started such a project without having knowledge in the domain or experience in building robots didn’t discourage us, so 2 months later after receiving the kit and doing a lot of research and self-training, the ideas of our team molded together so we had already designed our robot structure.
            After another 4 months, the robot was 80% done and was ready to make his first appearance in front of over 200 students and teachers, in the sports hall of our high school. With the occasion of this event, the competition sponsors, Vodafone, came to Alba Iulia for filming a commercial which accumulated over 60.000 views on YouTube.
            As time passed, Xeo transformed from a team into a family. From pieces of code assembled into a whole, to preparing food together, from broken motors and dozens of rethought ideas to the stress of the week before the competition, the team managed to finish the robot a night before travelling to the true trial.
              
            
             
            
            The contest was a different experience. It offered another perspective over work, over collaboration with other people from other areas, over the correct attitude and over the world. Looking in the past, we all remained with the idea that, from now, nothing will be the same. FTC Romania 2017 story from Xeo’s point of view:
            Thursday - 23.03.2017 – day
            We leave Alba Iulia to Bucharest in the morning, some of us with the car, for transporting the robot and the others with a coach. We arrive in Bucharest at the Polyvalent Hall around 16 o'clock and prepare the stand with materials prepared. There are few teams that have arrived so we don’t start to share materials this day, so we go to the hotel. After we accommodated and ate, we remember about two little problems: the system which lifts the big ball wasn’t working too good and we didn’t fixed the plexiglass panels on the robot. ”No worries, we have time in the morning.” One of our colleagues asked Ionuț Panea a question and, among other things, he asked us if we want to go to the HUB. Of course we wanted this, but the question came at 23:40, so we asked him if we can come at that hour. His answer mobilised us “You can come now if you want”.
            Thursday - 23.03.2017 – night
            That’s how the first all-nighter at Bucharest started. We left to the Polyvalent Hall with 3 taxis, with the robot and a few tools. We realised how big is the campus from the Bucharest Polytechnic when we had to carry the robot for minutes of walking, without knowing if we are going in the right direction. Eventually, we saw some windows through which some lights were lit. The closer we got, the music and the air hockey sounds got louder and louder. “This has to be it.” After so much time, we finally got to the HUB. We were welcomed by Ionuț and other members from Autovortex, which told us to find a table and get comfortable.
            The HUB impressed us. You find everything you need to make a world-class robot. Pieces and tools. Robot models (the Autovortex robot) and people who helps you with advices. An impressive place, for which we appreciate more the ones who worked at it.
            With all these though, we came here with an objective: “We have to finish the robot for tomorrow!” That’s how we started to optimise the big ball lift system and also to use the automated tools from Autovortex. Now we don’t need to wait 3 minutes to cut a profile, now we can do it in 5 seconds.
             
            
            But still, time was passing and our system was not done. It was 5 in the morning, and our system wasn’t lifting good enough. We also changed the weather strips this evening, and we noticed that the system is not working as good as we prepared it at home. Our main objective, the autonomous period, wasn’t even started. Even so, we managed to finish the stopper for the small balls to work.
              It’s 5 in the morning and it’s time to go to the hotel to get some sleep.
            
            Friday - 24.03.2017 - day
              We go to the Polyvalent Hall. We slept 2 hours. “Boys, today we are gonna sleep there, we’re ’so tired”  I  say to my colleagues. It wasn’t like that. We did well. At 8 o’clock we were mounting the plexiglass we forgot about the other night. We went over the 3 steps of testing: Judging, Robot Inspection, Field Inspection, all passed by our robot. We met the other teams and shared business cards with each other. At 4 PM we went to the hotel to sleep a few hours, knowing that in the evening we need to go to the HUB to get ready for the competition.
            
            Friday - 24.03.2017 - night
              We arrive at the HUB around 9 o’clock in the evening. Our objective was again, the autonomous period. After a few tests we notice that the robot moves chaotically. “What is he doing?! Why did you made him to to my right?” “If you find in the code something that makes the robot go to the right, I leave.” This, for us, to notice that the right motor has broken. With only 12 hours until the competition,. Ionuț Panea borrowed a motor so we could make the robot move again. “But again, this one broke for a reason. What will happen if we break the other one too?!” We figured out that the gear ratio was too big, 3:1 with a 6x4 traction - although Autovortex told us one night ago that even 2:1 ratio was big for these motors.
            Gooood, we rethought everything and made a 2:1 ratio. We found another problem, we didn’t have 80-teeth gears… We managed to do it, replacing another small system with a big gear. The place where we took the wheel from needed another 30 minutes or so for calibrating the new speed… it’s already 3 in the morning. We’re ordering pizza. We test the robot with a single pair of gears for the motion system. 
             
            
            It’s working. We begin the tests for the autonomous part, the reason we got there in the first place. The first functional test takes place around 5:30 in the morning. At 6 we head back to the hotel with the autonomous part working for the red team. For blue we didn’t have anything.
            
            Saturday - 25.03.2017 - the first day of the competition
            We arrive at the hotel at 7:15, we meet the rest of the team and our mentors which are shocked to see that we also brought the robot. They leave the hotel with the robot and we just go to take a shower so we can be at the Polyvalent Hall for the opening ceremony. We don’t need sleep :) (I’d also like to mention that among the people who haven’t slept are the 2 drivers and the coach).  The opening ceremony brought a solemn moment: the intonation of the national anthem. The whole Polyvalent Hall standing, everyone singing! Beautiful! #Romania
            Next on the to-do list is Drivers Meeting, where unfortunately we couldn’t hear anything, as it took place on the Polyvalent hall’s lobby. We learn that our first match begins in a couple of minutes. We’re ready to turn on the robot, we get the signal and it doesn’t. 
             
            A lack of communication between the assembly team and the programming team destroys our first game. Our robot doesn’t work in in the autonomous period and neither in the Tele-OP period. We apologize to our partners: TechnoCats! 
            A moment that surprised us is, a story told by Costica, a member of ours: “I couldn’t believe my eyes, why doesn’t it work?“ immediately after the match he heard 2 girls behind him : ”I really feel bad for Xeo, Ii was cheering for them…” . 
            At a test, a sensor wire got stuck between 2 gears and it broke…. After a no-sleep night it was the last thing it needed to happen. The sensor which the whole autonomous period was based on just broke… Luckily, we didn’t lose our composure and , being in a place full of gracious professionalism, 2 teams provided us with a copy of the sensor, and we want to thank them. The next match is coming up. In this one we manage to move pretty well on the playing field and we have the opportunity of having a one of our balls land in a opponent robot and thus, giving us a lot of points. The score is being shown, with the penalty points given to the other team instead of us. After many discussions with the referees they finally see the mistake and are happy to give us the points and we win the match. We thank our partners :  Aquila 100% !
            The third match puts us in alliance with one of the best teams of the competition, the team of the National College Tudor Vianu form Bucharest. The match was easily won with the score of 210 - 50 , even though our opponents were Dark Angels, the winners of the competition. Thank you Vianu Legends for a beautiful game!
            
             
            
            The fourth and final match of the day was in alliance with the team Novanoid FTC from Bucharest which we helped modify their autonomous period to match ours. We were full of hope about this match, but unfortunately, our inspection team forgot to tighten a screw that was tying the gear to one of our motor axel and we couldn’t move at all. We lost the match and we want to apologize to our partners for letting them down.
            We get back to the hotel around 6:30 PM . We don’t have time for sleep , we have to prepare the robot for the last day of the competition . Some of our teammates went in the city to eat something, others went to sleep.
            
            Saturday - 25.03.2017 - night
            It’s the 3rd consecutive night at HUB. We get there late and tired. Objectives : autonomous period for the blue part ( the next 2 matches were blue), the lifting system because without it we wouldn’t have had a chance in the last match. We change a lot at our throwing system, and we change a little bit the autonomous concept. The servos just wouldn’t work anymore, i mean, they were working but with other servo’s code. The servo controller broke. We changed it. Work, work work, a lot of problems, fatigue, we don’t remember a lot from that night. I remember that i fell asleep on a chair for 40 minutes. At 6 we test the robot.
            
            Sunday - 26.03.2017
            It is 7 o’clock , we’re taking a shower and then leave. The matches start at 8 and we have the 4’th matched programmed for us. Some of our colleagues arrived at Polyvalent Hall  with the robot from the HUB.  In our first match of the day, our autonomous period didn’t go as planned, as our lifting system blocked 2 balls inside the robot for a while and we couldn’t score more points than the enemy alliance. We’re sorry Transilvania Robotix RO026 , we also were expecting more from ourselves. In the second match , our partners were RoboTel. The game didn’t start very well for us, the hose used for lifting the small balls off the ground jumped over the wheels which were supposed to rotate it, thus, breaking the whole system. Although , in the end-game, we were able to lift up the big ball off the ground, winning the match. 
            
              The first 4 team were QUBE. , Dark Angels, RobotX Hunedoara si Vortex Breakers , which we congratulate! They chose another 2 team in order to compete for the big title.
              
             
            
            The final matches were astounding , playing a 2 out of 3 format. The blue team won the first match, and the team captain, Dark Angels from the High School “Odobleja” form Bucharest got an invitation for the USA competition. Also, the first and second places from the Inspire Award got invitations for the St. Louis competition. Congratulation Soft Hoarders and Impulsive - FTC !
            Revision: total hours of sleep - somewhere around 3 in total, from Thursday morning to monday morning on the train ride. It was worth!
            Impressions from FTC
            FTC is something else. You don’t know what FTC means until you get there , to see or to compete. You can not be mad after a competition like this. We got there and way underperformed, and although, it was incredible! It’s a unique experience to walk in Polyvalent Hall, being surrounded by other teams’ stands, to meet other people all around the country, to only see smiles and enthusiasm around you, to help other teams and be helped by others when in need, to leave Bucharest seeing that 90% of the teams don’t have the concept of “hate” , don’t have the concept of “having to win no matter what , at all costs”, it is amazing. This experience truly changed us, and we can not wait for the next year! And also, we’re looking forward to meet again the teams and maybe play some friendly matches. We promise to not underperform the next year and to surpass everyone’s expectations. We respect and congratulate every team! We also would like to thank for giving us the opportunity to take part in this amazing experience to Dana Războiu, Ionut Panea, Doina A. Danuta, Rares Badici, Robert Ngo-Van and many others!

            Mentors : Sebastian Onac, Carmen Maria, Laura Muresan
            
            Having last year’s experience, and the ambition to show our qualities, this season we wish to continue at the same pace . The theme of this year’s competition has been launched in 9th of september 2017 and we already began the construction. We’ve also began recruiting new members (from 10th grade and 11th grade) and it has 3 big categories : Assembly/Programming, Marketing/PR/Photo and 3D-Modeling.
